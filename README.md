In this Jupyter notebook, a neural network classifier, logistic regression, Random Forest and Adaboost models are tested for disaster tweet classification. It compares the performance of these models and demonstrates that stacking a Logistic Regression model, Random Forest, and Adaboost outperforms the other approaches, achieving an AUC of 0.849 on the test data.
